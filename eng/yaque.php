					<br><br>
					This little paradise, a stopover point for Columbus on his third voyage, is located in the crystalline waters of the Caribbean Sea, just a 35-minute flight from Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. Margarita with its pleasant dry and ventilated tropical climate and an average temperature of 27ºC, is an unavoidable destination for enjoyment, relaxation and fun. Its incomparable landscapes and a 168 kilometer coastline with 150 dream beaches have led it to earn the title of the Pearl of the Caribbean.</p>

					<br><br>
					El Yaque Beach, located just 5 minutes from the airport, is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and popular beaches on Margarita Island. </p>
					Due to its strong and constant winds, it is considered one of the five best places in the world to practice Windsurfing and Kitesurfing. But its beautiful beach with calm and shallow waters, surrounded by shops, restaurants and cozy bars around the beach and the main street, also attracts tourism in search of sun, tranquility and a bit of glamour. </p>
					The more than 20 different restaurants and beach bars for all tastes, from Thai food, the freshest fish or seafood by the sea, or simply the best pizza or pasta on the Island ... and all within walking distance, quietly and 100% sure. </p>
					We are surrounded by the Laguna de las Marites and its National Park, which you can explore by kayak, or by hiking along trails, appreciating the fascinating xerophilous vegetation that characterizes this region. </p>
